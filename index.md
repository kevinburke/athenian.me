# Learn to Code Interim

### Interim Goals

* Learn the basics of making interesting and pretty things with a computer.
* Learn how to persist when you get stuck, and don't know how to fix something.
* Build the skills [to debug problems in programs you are writing][xkcd].
* Learn how to learn, e.g. how to continue building your skill set after this
  interim.
* Find out how the Internet, browsers, and mobile phones work

### Schedule

**Monday and Tuesday**

We will meet at 8:30 AM in a location to be determined, either the library
computer lab or the Middlefield lab. The day will conclude at 3:00PM. I will
probably stay late to help you with any projects or ideas that you're working
on.


**Wednesday**

On Wednesday we will take BART into San Francisco and visit two startup
companies' offices in SOMA. We will meet at Walnut Creek BART at 8am. We will
take BART to Embarcadero. Afterwards, we will eat lunch and head back to Walnut
Creek on BART, no later than 2:30PM. We will finalize the timing as we get
closer to the start of Interim.


### Equipment

You are encouraged to bring and use your own laptop, if you have one. This
way, any work that's done during the interim can continue to be used and
improved after Interim. School provided computers will be available and they
are completely suitable for the interim curriculum. **Please,** do not purchase
a laptop solely for this interim - 90% of the curriculum will be completed with
a text editor and a Web browser, tools available on every computer on the
planet.

All operating systems (Mac, PC, Linux) are suitable. Students using their own
laptops are encouraged to install the following free programs before the start
of Interim:

- A [text editor][editor]. I recommend [Notepad++][notepad] for PC and
  [TextWrangler][wrangler] for Mac. Linux users can use [gedit][gedit].
- A modern web browser such as [Firefox][firefox] or [Google Chrome][chrome]
- A client for uploading files to a web server, such as [FileZilla Client][filezilla].
- [Python 2.7](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

### BART Notes

- We are responsible for the safety and oversight of the students on the field
trip on Wednesday. Unfortunately, this means students must meet us at Walnut
Creek BART on Wednesday morning.
- If you are planning to park at the Walnut Creek station, the lot tends to
fill up by 7:35 AM on commute days. You can park in nearby lots, but it may
cost anywhere from $10 to $15 (versus $1 for the BART parking lot).
- Andrew and I will distribute BART tickets to students on Wednesday; do not
worry about purchasing your own ticket.

### Food Notes

- On Monday and Tuesday, you should bring a bag lunch, or purchase lunch from
the school cafeteria. On Wednesday, you should bring money for lunch in SF. We
are not sure of the exact location, but the cost for food + drink on Wednesday
should not exceed $13.

out of the short amount of time that we have together.
